                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                    into a
                    horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
                    brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able
                    to
                    cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the
                    size
                    of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It
                    wasn't
                    a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four
                    familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling
                    salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine
                    and
                    housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
                    upright,
                    raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then
                    turned
                    to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops
