## Purpose
With this project is pretended to build up skills on constructing websites by using HTML and CSS as primary framework, and also as an online portfolio for future employers that might be interested on looking at products of my own manufacture. The minimalist design pretends to show my abilities to understand, create, and modify features in a website using HTML and CSS primarly, but this initial version of this portfolio does not intend to highlight my graphical design abilities.

This also will be considered as an assignment to gain a qualification in the future, as a full stack web developer.

## Functionality and Features
This portfolio shows a Home page housing four main different pages with images, text, links, animated links, buttons and a form for user input. The website in intended to be easily browsed, with few information, simple buttons and minimalist design.
